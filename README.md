## SpotiStats
SpotiStats is a simple python script that allows you to see how many minutes you've spent listening to music on Spotify this year.

> **Note**: This application is not affiliated with Spotify. This application uses personal Spotify data, and though this application does not store any of your data, use at your own risk.

# Why?

Though Spotify Wrapped shows this information every year, I wanted to see whether or not I could find the information in a similar way without having to wait for the year to end.

Since this python script directly uses Spotify data retrieved from the user's account, it is very accurate, taking in exactly how many milliseconds listened per track instead of the full track length, displaying exactly how much time was spent listening this year.

# Usage & Pre-requisites

 - Python 3.8
 - tkinter

 > **Note**: You will need to install these manually, this readme does not cover the installation of these dependancies.

You will also need to retrieve your data from Spotify. This can be done by going to the Spotify website, and then clicking on the "Privacy" tab in the account settings and then 
requesting the data. After this is done, you will need to wait for a few days for them to send it to you.
